#README Generator

  ## Description

  This project was created in order to help create an easy and customizable template to use when generating a read me file for any given project or application. The reason behind this application is to make generating read me files for any project a simple and easier task, and create professional readme files. Throughout my time creating this application, I learned how to use a utlity folder and importing different npm packages.
